            <p><strong>Bug Splat</strong> is a simple yet engaging web-based game where players must eliminate alien bugs that have infested their home.</p>
            
            <h3>Game Description</h3>
            <p>Your home is under siege by dangerous alien bugs. Negotiations have failed, so you have no choice but to splat them. Click on 15 bugs to eliminate them, but bewareâ€”these bugs won't go down without a fight, making comments to try and dissuade you. The game features two modes: regular and "more annoying" mode for an extra challenge.</p>
    
            <h3>Gameplay</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Click on bugs to splat them. A splatted bug will be replaced with a splat image.</li>
                <li>Bugs will make unique comments to distract or insult you throughout the game.</li>
                <li>Bug behavior changes when fewer than 8 bugs remain, ramping up the challenge.</li>
            </ul>
