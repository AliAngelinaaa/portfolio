            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Game Description</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Your home is under siege by dangerous alien bugs. Negotiations have failed, so you have no choice but to splat them. Click on 15 bugs to eliminate them, but bewareâ€”these bugs won't go down without a fight, making comments to try and dissuade you. The game features two modes: regular and "more annoying" mode for an extra challenge.</p>

We worked in teams of four and had to create a website that would help people find clubs and organizations within all the colleges as many people do not know what their options are. I took the lead on the website as the project manager and worked on the website with my team. I learned a lot about project management and how to work with others to meet a common goal. It was a great learning experience and I am proud of the website we created."

The New York Times have a yearly one week hackathon where developers and other members within the company come together and get to work on projects and learn new things. This is also the best time to meet new people and get closer with your team as everyone comes over to the NYC office during this time. My internship had me using a bit of Go so I decided to learn more about the language and create a product that WITU may use in the end."
