Over the course of three days, we were taught the basics of web design, with each day focusing on a different element such as HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. Using these newly acquired skills, we were tasked with creating a project to assist our peers.</p>

    <img src=${study} alt="Study Timer Screenshot 1" class="w-full rounded-lg shadow-md my-4" />

    <p>Our team consisted of three members. Initially, it started as a duo but later expanded to include a third member. The objective was to develop a tool that could improve users' lives, particularly by helping them manage their schoolwork or daily tasks. After reflecting on how timing oneself could help complete multiple assignments efficiently, we decided to create a study timer.</p>

    <p>As the team member with the most web design experience, I was responsible for implementing the JavaScript portion of the project. Although the program primarily focused on Bootstrap and frontend coding, many students struggled to understand how to incorporate JavaScript into their projects. I helped bridge that gap for our team.</p>

    <p>While my focus was on making the timer function correctly, my teammates provided valuable assistance by reviewing the code and identifying issues that I might have overlooked. Their fresh perspectives helped troubleshoot and refine the project.</p>

    This was the first project created during the Human-Computer Interaction course. As a solo endeavor, I focused on applying the principles of user-centered design to develop an intuitive and responsive to-do list application. This project allowed me to explore various aspects of UI/UX design, ensuring that users could easily navigate and interact with the application.
</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-base text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    Utilizing Bootstrap, I was able to rapidly prototype the layout and design of the application. Bootstrap's grid system and pre-defined components facilitated a clean and organized structure, allowing me to create a visually appealing interface without sacrificing functionality. I leveraged Bootstrap's responsive design features to ensure that the application performed seamlessly across various devices, from desktop to mobile, enhancing accessibility for all users.
</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-base text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    Throughout the development process, I prioritized usability by conducting user testing sessions to gather feedback on the application's functionality and design. This iterative approach helped refine the user experience, leading to a polished final product. The to-do list application not only demonstrated my coding abilities but also my commitment to creating user-friendly software.
</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-base text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    Overall, this project laid a strong foundation for my understanding of human-computer interaction principles and reinforced the importance of considering user needs in the development process.

  This project, <strong>Polyglot Palace</strong>, was developed over the span of three weeks as part of the TTP program, where teams of four were tasked with applying the skills acquired in the initial four-week training. Our goal was to build a full-stack web application that demonstrated a deep understanding of both front-end and back-end technologies, focusing on scalability, performance, and user experience.

<p class="mb-4">
  I played a central role in the overall design and development of the application. I was primarily responsible for the creation of the wireframes, which laid the groundwork for our application's structure and user flow.
  In addition to the design, I handled most of the Redux integration, which was essential for managing the application's global state. Redux allowed us to streamline data flow across different components, making it easier to manage and update states consistently, especially when dealing with complex data sets.</p> <img src=${polyglotpalacewf} alt="Polyglot Palace Screenshot 2" class="w-full max-w-2xl mx-auto rounded-lg shadow-md hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow duration-300 cursor-pointer" onclick="openImageModal(this.src)" /> <img src=${polyglotpalacewf1} alt="Polyglot Palace Screenshot 2" class="w-full max-w-2xl mx-auto rounded-lg shadow-md hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow duration-300 cursor-pointer" onclick="openImageModal(this.src)" />
